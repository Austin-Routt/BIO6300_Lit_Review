# BIO6300_Lit_Review
A literature review on the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in constructing reaction network-based biological models, with a focus on red blood cells (RBCs). It was written in haste for BIOE 6300 (Mathematical Methods in Biomedical Engineering) at the University of Houston. It's very basic, and I might improve it.
